# Analyzing Pruning Methods in Neural Networks and Their Influence on Accuracy
## Overview
Building large neural networks makes Neural Networks train successfully and perform better in various tasks. However, this makes them expensive, more time-consuming, and more challenging to distribute with more storage space. Therefore, Pruning was introduced to reduce the models' size by removing parameters from the existing network while maintaining accuracy.
