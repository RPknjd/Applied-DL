# Analyzing Pruning Methods in Neural Networks and Their Influence on Accuracy
## Overview

Building large neural networks makes Neural Networks train successfully and perform better in various tasks. However, this makes them expensive, more time-consuming, and more challenging to distribute with more storage space. Therefore, Pruning was introduced to reduce the models' size by removing parameters from the existing network while maintaining accuracy. In other words, Pruning is a set of techniques that lower the computational demands of a neural network by removing weights, filters, neurons, or other structures.
